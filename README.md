KCLTechPythonExamples
=====================

This repo contains examples of basic Python programs, created as resources to support the KCL Tech Society's beginner programming lectures.

Examples are often added during and after lectures. They are designed to help attendees of the lectures by showing one way of achieving each task, but you should remember that there are usually many different ways to program something, and no one is claiming these are the "best" way.

The code samples here are completely public - use them however you wish.

If you want to discuss any of these examples or if you have questions, head over to KCL Tech's public Slack (kcltechhq.slack.com) and check out the #beginner-programming channel - someone there will help you. If you want to talk to me directly, just tag me or message me on Slack - my username is @markormesher.
